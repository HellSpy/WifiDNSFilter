Wifi DNS filter project

# Wifi DNSFilter

Wifi DNSFilter is a web application designed to provide DNS filtering capabilities to block unwanted domains, such as those serving advertisements or malicious content. The application includes a backend server built with Flask and a frontend client built with React.

## Project Overview

### Backend

The backend of Wifi DNSFilter is implemented using Flask, a lightweight web framework for Python. It handles DNS requests, manages the blocklist, and serves the API endpoints used by the frontend.

### Frontend

The frontend of Wifi DNSFilter is developed using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It provides an interactive interface for managing the blocklist and viewing statistics.

## Features

- **DNS Filtering:** Intercepts DNS requests and blocks domains based on a customizable blocklist.
- **Blocklist Management:** Add or remove domains from the blocklist through an intuitive web interface.
- **Statistics:** View statistics on the number of DNS requests and blocked domains.

## Running the Application

To start the application, ensure that the backend server and frontend client are running. Access the frontend application in your web browser to interact with the DNS filter.

### Accessing the Frontend

Open your web browser and navigate to the specified URL to access the DNSFilter web interface. Here, you can manage the blocklist and view statistics.

### API Endpoints

The application includes several API endpoints for managing the blocklist and retrieving statistics. These endpoints are used by the frontend to perform actions such as adding or removing domains from the blocklist.

## Development

Wifi DNSFilter is currently in development. Further updates and improvements are planned to enhance functionality and user experience. Stay tuned for future releases.
